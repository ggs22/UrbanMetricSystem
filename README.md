> numerous problems stemming from of the various concepts of urban areas. It is based on space‐
> the absence of a mathematical definition of the boundaries economy, especially, land‐rent theory,
> the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces, as well as vector fields. [...] City. Based on
> the proposed UMS, a synthetic index of urban sprawl is defined and computed for the studied
> metropolitan
> areas."
